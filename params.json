That's magical.\r\n\r\nYou can add to the web from anywhere in the world and consume it globally as well. You can do it at any time and from many devices. The web is about breaking these fundamental barriers of space and time and transmuting old modes of interaction into new ones.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to go to a library to do your research.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to go to the opera to listen to your favorite arias.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to go to the store to buy stuff.\r\n\r\n**With the web, everything you know is wrong. Welcome to a brave new world.**\r\n\r\nIf you're a businessperson, you can sell anything you want to people all around the world with the click of a button. If you're a teacher, you can teach to people on the other side of the world watching your lessons years after they've been put online. If you're an artist, you can show your work to a global crowd much larger than any museum can hold. If you're willing to break the old rules, you can decide what the new ones will be.\r\n\r\n**The chains are gone, the power is in your hands.**\r\n\r\nOf course, I'm not the kind of persons to preach absolute truths.\r\n\r\nThe web is as much about the people as it is about the connections between them.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think the web is about?\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Azarkevich, 20.06.2013 22:37, Israel\r\n\r\n@M_Azarkevich\r\n\r\nThis post is a response (laced with gentle plagiarism) to Justin Jackson's post [\"Words\"](http://justinjackson.ca/words.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
