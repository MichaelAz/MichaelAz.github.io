        <p>There's not much here.</p>

<p>Just words.</p>

<p>And you're reading them.</p>

<p><strong>But you can do so much more.</strong></p>

<p>The web is a medium that allows for interactions that are impossible to reproduce in other media.</p>

<p>You can read, you can view, you can listen, you can watch, <strong>but these are all just modes of usage.</strong></p>

<p>The web isn't inherently about words, pictures, music or videos - <strong>It's about connectivity.</strong></p>

<p>You can use it to emulate older media like the book or DVD or create novel applications like games or code repositories but by doing it on the web you open it to the world. That's magical.</p>

<p>You can add to the web from anywhere in the world and consume it globally as well. You can do it at any time and from many devices. The web is about breaking these fundamental barriers of space and time and transmuting old modes of interaction into new ones.</p>

<p>You don't need to go to a library to do your research.</p>

<p>You don't need to go to the opera to listen to your favorite arias.</p>

<p>You don't need to go to the store to buy stuff.</p>

<p><strong>With the web, everything you know is wrong. Welcome to a brave new world.</strong></p>

<p>If you're a businessperson, you can sell anything you want to people all around the world with the click of a button. If you're a teacher, you can teach to people on the other side of the world watching your lessons years after they've been put online. If you're an artist, you can show your work to a global crowd much larger than any museum can hold. If you're willing to break the old rules, you can decide what the new ones will be.</p>

<p><strong>The chains are gone, the power is in your hands.</strong></p>

<p>Of course, I'm not the kind of persons to preach absolute truths.</p>

<p>The web is as much about the people as it is about the connections between them.</p>

<p>What do you think the web is about?</p>
